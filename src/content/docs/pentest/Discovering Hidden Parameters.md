Many developers believe in obscurity as a defence mechanism, so if a parameter is not documented they believe an attacker won't be able to find it. Common parameters to look out for:
- Debug parameters
- Internal-only or admin functionality
- Legacy API endpoints
- Undocumented parameters not meant for users

## HTML input fields
Scrape HTML elements with `id` and `name` attributes by crawling the target site. Tools:
- GoSpider
- GetAllParams
Enable hidden form in burp:

## JavaScript file enumeration
Look for parameters in JavaScript files. 
### Variable names
Find variable names in JavaScript files then try each of them as a `GET/POST` parameters.
```js
see var siteKey = "Uqf9TX"
try https://host.com?siteKey=";alert(0)//
```
### Intercepting client-side parameters
Another way to detect new parameters is to intercept them on the client-side. Tools like Eval Villain allow you to intercept and get notified if any of the supplied input parameters are processed by the DOM. This behaviour often indicates a possible DOM-based vulnerability, such as DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Google/Github/Wayback Machine enumeration
### Google dorking
```
site:.example.com inurl:? || inurl:&
```

Same for Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex and Github.

### Internet Archive
1. Go to https://web.archive.org/
2. Search for target
3. Filter for indexed URLs that contain query parameters.

*TIP! Found an interesting JavaScript file? Try to view an indexed version on the Wayback Machine to potentially find even more (legacy) parameters!*
