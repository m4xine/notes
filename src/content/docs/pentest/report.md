# Executive Summary

This document outlines the findings from a **web application penetration test** performed as part of a certification assessment. The goal of the test was to identify security weaknesses in the provided web application(s), simulate potential exploitation, and recommend appropriate remediation strategies.

The assessment focused on application-layer vulnerabilities and followed industry-standard methodologies to simulate real-world attack scenarios.

## Methodology

The web penetration test covered a wide range of common and advanced vulnerabilities in both web applications and APIs. The assessment included testing for authentication and authorization attacks, broken access control, server-side request forgery (SSRF), advanced SQL and NoSQL injection, file inclusion, XML External Entity (XXE) injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) including filter bypasses, JSON Web Token (JWT) attacks, mass assignment vulnerabilities, open redirects, race conditions, excessive data exposure, and command injection.

A combination of manual testing and automated scanning tools was used to identify, validate, and document vulnerabilities, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the target environment.

## Scope

The assessment was limited to the web applications and services explicitly included in the exam lab. Testing was confined to:

| Application / URL             | Description                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `http://target.local/`        | Main application interface   |
| `http://api.target.local/`    | Backend API service          |
| `http://admin.target.local/`  | Admin portal (if applicable) |

No testing was performed against any systems or endpoints outside the lab-provided environment.

## Summary of Findings

Several security issues were identified during the test, including vulnerabilities related to input handling, access control, and misconfigurations. These were categorized as follows:

- **Critical:** 1
- **High:** 2
- **Medium:** 2
- **Low:** 1
- **Informational:** 1

All identified issues are outlined with reproduction steps, potential impacts, and recommended fixes.

| Impact       | Full authentication bypass and data exposure via backend SQL queries         |
| Description  | User input was unsafely concatenated into an SQL query.                      |
| References   | [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) |

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to the login page.
2. Submit payload: `' OR '1'='1` as the username.
3. Observe successful login without valid credentials.

### Evidence
(Screenshot of successful login or captured response.)

### Remediation
- Use prepared statements or ORM frameworks.
- Sanitize and validate input at both client and server levels.
- Implement logging and alerting for abnormal login activity.

# Appendix

## Severity Ratings

The table below defines the severity levels used in this report, along with their corresponding CVSS v3.1 score ranges:

| Severity      | CVSS v3.1 Score Range | Description                                                                                          |
